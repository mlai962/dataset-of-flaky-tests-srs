# dataset-of-flaky-tests-srs
University of Auckland Summer Research Scholarship project for building a comprehensive dataset of non-deterministic tests from GitHub projects.

Intermittent test failures (test flakiness) have become a serious and acknowledged issue in modern software development. Understanding test flakiness is crucial as intermittent test failures might be the result of real non-deterministic defects in the production code, rather than mere errors in the test code. Large organizations such as Facebook, Google, Huawei, Microsoft, and Mozilla are increasingly reporting problems with flaky tests. A key issue is that flaky tests lead to unreliable signals that can erode the trust of developers in their tests. The research community lacks a well-defined dataset of real flaky tests to validate new test flakiness detection techniques. The goal of this project is to construct a comprehensive dataset of reproducible flaky tests. This research project touches many aspects of Software Engineering and Software Testing, like mining software repositories, build automation, static and dynamic code analysis.
